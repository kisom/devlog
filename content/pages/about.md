Title: About

Lately, I've been going through a period of tech exhaustion, maybe
burnout. If I think back to the times where I really enjoyed
computers, they were almost always when I was learning new things and
doing weird things with computers (for example, [writing a web
server](https://git.kyleisom.net/server/srvwd/), [experimenting with
file stores](https://github.com/kisom/cl-nebula), [writing virtual
machines](https://git.kyleisom.net/explore/kram), and [CPU
emulators](https://git.kyleisom.net/explore/k6502)) --- generally
spending more time thinking than the mechanics of software
engineering. I'd like to rekindle this interest, so I'm trying to
explore more.
