Title: Projects

Usually, I'll mark posts related to ongoing projects with a relevant tag. This
page keeps track of them.

## Active
+ [BLE sensor network](/tag/bluetooth.html): I'm using an nRF52 board
  to build a small network of sensors to deploy in my garden.

## Semi-Active
+ [Write You a Forth](/tag/wyaf.html): I'm writing a Forth with the main goal
  of getting it working on a blue pill dev board.

+ [The Blue Pill](/tag/bluepill.html): I've picked up some rather cheap STM32
  dev boards; the goal is to get a Forth working but there's a lot of work
  building a framework around this.
