It's been over a week since I last updated this. I haven't done much dev work
on my own in that time, except to start with a React app using a Django Rest
Framework background. I also started back on the Algorithns and Data Structures
class. Mostly, though, it's been work and interviewing.

I've been thinking a lot about the natural computing stuff I talked about in a
previous post. I need to write more about that; it will probably end up in my
notebook rather than in my dev logs.

I've made a little progress on the last 24 app. I ended up retargeting it to do
a more Kanban-style tracking after picking up Trello. I've been running on
little sleep lately (mostly due to the work & interview thing, but also some
general life stuff), though, and I'm going to need to make sure I'm getting
enough to be able to think about some of the more interesting topics (linear
algebra, etc).
