Okay, working through the algorithmic toolbox class. It took me a day
to work out the fractional knapsack problem. It took a couple read
throughs of the forum threads, but I finally figured out my problem.

I was trying to compute the best value by iterating over the list of
items and computing something to the effect of 

```c++
Item
max_value(int capacity, Item item)
{
    if (item.weight == 0) {
        item.value = 0;
        return item;
    }
    if (capacity >= item.weight) {
        return item;
    }

    auto weight = capacity;
    double frac = static_cast<double>(weight) / static_cast<double>(item.weight);

    item.value *= frac;
    item.weight = weight;
    return item;
}
```

The key insight was to add another field to the items representing the
value to weight ratio, sort the vector of items, and keep taking items
from the top until there's no room left. Once I did that, the problem
passed.

Thinking about sorting the list made solving the next problem easier:
given two lisys of numbers (*a* and *b*), find the maximum value of
the sum of products of pairs. For example, given *a &larr; (1, 3, -5)*
and *b &larr; (-2, 4, 1)*, the optimum pairing is *3x4 + 1x1 +
-5x-2*. The way to do this is to sort both lists, multiply each pair,
and add the results together.

It's fun solving problems again, even if they feel a bit contrived.
