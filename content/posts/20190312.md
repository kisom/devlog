Well, I'm [not unemployed anymore](https://dropbox.com/). I did get a
few interesting things done over funemployment:

* I worked through a bunch of electronics stuff.
* I (re)discovered my Feathers and got some more.
* Wrote an AVR I2C implementation and had to debug it with an oscilloscope.
* Wrote a lot of feather code and finally put it into a library.
* Started working on a LoRa mesh.
* Gave micro/circuitpython a fair shake.

And I have more stuff going on:

* Working on a LoRa gateway to extend networks of small sensors - there
  are solutions for this, but this is a forcing function for making me
  think and learn about network design.
* Working on an OTA update system for micropython.

After working on a largish feather project (my computational beauty of
nature [playground](https://github.com/kisom/gol), I decided to turn
the HAL into a standalone library, the [featherlib](https://github.com/kisom/featherlib).

In the CBN project, I had the HAL implemented as static instances hidden in the header file,
roughly along the lines of this:

```c++
// lib/hal/graphics.cc
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <string.h>

#include <hal/graphics.h>
#include <hal/power.h>


namespace hal {

        // ...

        namespace OLED {
        
        
                // The Adafruit SSD1306 in use is the FeatherWing version.
                //      https://www.adafruit.com/product/2900
                Adafruit_SSD1306        oled(128, 32, &Wire);
        

                void
                setup()
                {
                        oled.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C);
                        oled.setTextSize(1);
                        oled.setTextColor(WHITE);        // Draw white text
                        oled.clearDisplay();
                }

                // ...

        }
}
```

In featherlib, I went with a class-based approach; the above implementation would look more like

```c++
// include/feather/wing/oled.h
// ...


class OLED : public FeatherWing {
public:
        // ...
        bool             setup();
        // ...
private:
        // ...
        Adafruit_SSD1306        oled;
        // ...
};
```

with an implementation similar to the above:

```c++
// src/wing_oled.cc
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <feather/wing/oled.h>
#include <feather/wing/wing.h>


bool
OLED::setup()
{
        if (!this->oled.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C)) {
                return false;
        }
        this->oled.setTextSize(1);
        this->oled.setTextColor(WHITE);        // Draw white text
        this->oled.clearDisplay();
        return true;
}

// ...
```

There's advantages and disadvantages to both of these, but I've noticed
the effect that it has on my code: with the class-based system, all of the
peripheral interaction happens in `main.cc` - where the peripherals are
declared as global objects. I suppose I could do something like `extern
GPS gps` elsewhere, but I do kind of like having the top-level code all
together in one file. This works building small motes or control systems,
but CBN would suffer - especially considering each of the "experiments"
has a need to access the graphics directly or something similar. The jury's
still out, and I don't have a *ton* of experience with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
so we'll see if it pans out.

There's more I could write about the OTA idea, but I'll save that for tomorrow.
