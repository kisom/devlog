As I mentioned [yesterday](/posts/2018/05/03/ble-beacon-experiment-2/), I
was going to look at [libblepp](https://github.com/edrosten/libblepp)
before doing further with DBus. So... I
[did](https://github.com/kisom/sketchbooks/blob/12d77437431dfe3f082ecd7c83b5ecb7870b1bb1/pc/ble/scanner.cc).
With significantly less code, I already have working code that filters out
beacons. So now I'm at the point where I need to figure out how to parse
iBeacons. I have some ideas for this, and the next steps are going to be
testing them out.
