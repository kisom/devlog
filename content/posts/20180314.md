Work has been a pain lately and I've been preoccupied with the motorcycle, so
I've kind of dropped off my other projects. I need to get back to those. I
also think I'm going to start on
[bitwise](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise) which covers a lot of my
interests. The code's going in the sandbox.

On the plus side, I need to write it up, but I got my pure-asm STM32 program
working. I'm still running into boot/flashing issues, so I need to sort that
out still.
