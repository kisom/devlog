Jeremy pointed out a video that Joe
Armstrong [gave a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I_jE0l7sYQ)
at Code Beam SF. It has a bunch of useful and thought-provoking things
that will hopefully be a source for future posts.

> Also interested in really silly ideas in Computer Science.

> Which ideas of today will people in 20 years time say “well that was a really stupid idea”

## Computer Science things

### Papers to read

- [The Emperor's Old Clothes](/files/papers/hoare-turing.pdf)
- [A Plea for Lean Software](/files/papers/wirth-plea.pdf)

### Old tools to learn

- emacs
- bash
- make
- shell

### Four bad things

- vendor lock-in
- lack of privacy
- social media manipulation
- terms and conditions

### Three books

- Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs
- Mythical Man Months
- How to Win Friends

### One fun programming exercise

- [A syntax-oriented compiler writing language](/files/papers/meta-2.pdf)

### Eight great machines from the past

- Baby SSEM
- PDP 11
- Vax 11/750
- Cray 1
- IBM PC
- RPi
- iPhone/iPad
- nvidia tesla p100

### Three performance improvements

- better algorithms
- better programming languages (example given was prolog -> C)
- better hardware

### Five videos to watch

- [The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet - Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY)
- [Computers for Cynics - Ted Nelson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ3gmh-d9oI)
- [Free is a Lie - Aral Balkan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upu0gwGi4FE)
- [How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every
  day - Tristan Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C74amJRp730)
- [Winning the War on Error - Matt Might](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdmQUlD7P40)

### Five sins

- crap docs
- crap website
- crap deps
- crap build instructions
- group think

### Four forgotten ideas

- Linda tuple spaces
- flow-based programming
- xanadu
- unix pipes (killed by guis)

### Six research fields

- robotics
- AI
- programmer productivity
- energy efficiency
- precision medicine
- security

### Two dangers

- group think
- bubble think

### Four ideas that are obvious now but strange at first

- indentation
- versioning
- hypertext across machine boundaries
- pipes

### Two programs to try

- tiddlywiki
- sonicpi

- - -

## Not computer science things

### Learn to write

### Three rules at work

- if you get a bad boss, move immediately
- the relationship comes first (Jane Walerud)
- engage with management

### Seven distractions

- open plan offices
- the latest stuff
- social media
- notifications
- links (don't click them)
- ban scrum, etc...
- one thing at a time

### Six ways to get your boss to \$THING

- do things that gain trust
- tell success stories
- reduce fear of failure
- introduce on a small scale
- network with \$THING folks
- make a prototype at home

### One thing to look at when applying for a new job

- balance sheet: positive cash flow. companies with a negative cash
  flow won't innovate and are terrible to work for

### Three general laws

- software complexity grows with time
- bad code crowds out good (gresham's law), bad money drives out good
    (clipping)
- bad code contaminates good code

### Laws of physics and maths

- a computation can only occur when data and the program are at the
  same point in space-time
- causality: effect follows cause; we don't how stuff is, we know how
  it was
- 2nd law of thermodynamics: entropy always increases
  - git keeps all versions: increases entropy, cancer

- - -

## Half forgotten BIG ideas in CS

### Things can be small

- Forth OS: 24kB
- Forth compiler: 12kB
- IBM PC DOS: &lt; 640kB
- USCD Pascal
- Turbo Pascal
- Turbo C

### Four old truths

- keep it simple
- keep it small
- make it correct
- fight complexity

### The web is broken

- asymmetric: users read a lot but write little
- can every page be changed?
- can't make data by combining fragments from other data in a flexible
  manner
- web is controlled by a few huge companies using huge data centres
- original vision was a web controlled by citizen programmers

### HTTP/HTML are broken

- easy to read, hard to write
- pages disappear
- asymmetric
- links are wrong
- reuse, IP, attribution, payments are a mess
- controlled by small number of companies

#### wikis

- kind of work
- links can't be lost
- all in one place

#### Xanadu

- like the web but better
- no broken links
- no difference between reading and writing
- data could be reused
- never lose data
- copyright/attribution correctly handled
- complete knowledge of parents/children

#### unbreak the web

- make it symmetric: easy to both read and write
- bring computation back to the edge
- personal data personally owned
- make computing easy again
- build apps for intercommunicability

- - -

## Parting thoughts

- "a program that is not secure and cannot be remotely controlled
  should not be written"
- "we've given millions of people supercomputers - so let them use
  them and ... it's your turn next"
