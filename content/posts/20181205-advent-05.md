I approached this like a parsing problem. My base react function takes a stream
of characters, and collapses them as reactions are found. Basically, I keep a
stack of characters as I read them, then compare the latest character to the top
of the stack. If they're a match, I pop off the stack and keep going. Otherwise,
I push the new character onto the stack.

```python
def react(stream):
    last = stream.read(1)
    result = '' + last
    current = stream.read(1)

    while len(current) > 0:
        if result != '':
            if last.upper() == current.upper() and last != current:
                result = result[:-1]
                if result != '':
                    last = result[-1]
            else:
                last = current
                result += last
        else:
            last = current
            result += last
        current = stream.read(1)

    return result
```

For the second part, I created a set of all the characters in the uppercased
string. For each character in this set, I remove all occurrences of it (both
upper and lowercase), then react. I kept a map of removed base -> size of the
result, and return the minimum of this map.

```python
def reactall(s):
    results = {}
    x = set(s.upper())
    for base in x:
        s2 = s.replace(base, '')
        s2 = s2.replace(base.lower(), '')
        result = react(io.StringIO(s2))
        results[base] = len(result)
    return min(results.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1))
```

In all, it took about a half-second to run.
