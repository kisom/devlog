As a followup on the [BLE](/posts/2018/05/08/adventures-in-ble-beacons-day-5/)
adventures, the Bluefruit is still going. No updates on that; I'm going to have
to dig up the small panel so as not to waste the big one.

I started a new Django app to test out what I've been learning. It's a last/next
24 app, based on what I used to do with one of my managers. Basically, you say
what you did in the last 24 hours and what you plan on doing in the next 24. I
need to spend some time thinking about how this will work and designing the
views and models.
