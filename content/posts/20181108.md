I did some more work on [whereami](https://github.com/kisom/whereami).
There were a few big things:

* I chose [Scotty](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) as the 
  web framework. I'd started using a few years ago for a different 
  project, and Taylor reconfirmed it, so it seemed like a good idea.
* I replaced my use of the Geodesics package. I'd wanted to use it so
  later I could do more GIS stuff with it, but it ended up adding a
  lot of extra complexity (and it wasn't Aeson-compatible). My new
  data type is a simple record:

``` haskell

data Coordinates = Coordinates {
      latitude :: Double
    , longitude :: Double
    , altitude :: Double
} deriving (Generic, Read, Show)
```

* I added the first route with a GET and POST. 
* I wrote a simple Python test client:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""Simple Python client for testing the API."""

import json
import requests
import sys

URI = 'http://127.0.0.1:4000/coordinates'
OAK = {"latitude": 37.8044, "longitude": -122.2711, "altitude": 13.0}

def to_coordinates(lat, lon, alt):
    return {'latitude': lat, 'longitude': lon, 'altitude': altitude}

def print_response(res):
    if res['success']:
        c = res['coordinates']
        print(f"  OK: {c['latitude']}° {c['longitude']}° at {c['altitude']}m")
    else:
        print(f"FAIL: {res['message']}")

def get_coordinates():
    return requests.get(URI).json()

def set_coordinates(lat, lon, alt):
    return requests.post(URI, json=to_coordinates(lat, lon, alt)).json()

def set_oakland():
    return requests.post(URI, json=OAK).json()

COMMANDS = {'get': get_coordinates, 'set': set_oakland}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        print_response(get_coordinates())
    else:
        if sys.argv[1] in COMMANDS:
            print_response(COMMANDS[sys.argv[1]]())
        else:
            print('invalid command: {}'.format(', '.join(COMMANDS.keys())))
```

Lo and behold:

  OK: 0.0° 0.0° at 0.0m
```

With that said, there's a long list of TODOs for this first milestone, which is
just having GET and POST endpoint taking / returning JSON and with basic auth
on the POST and that doesn't persist a history of coordinates.

* The big issue right now is that the IORef isn't updating. Then I tried switching
  to STM, but that didn't work either. Note that in the client run above, the
  last two lines should match. I suspect this has something to do with threads.
* I have to do `unsafePerformIO` in some places, because I'm storing the
  current position as an <s>`IORef`</s>`STM.TVar`. It's probably not the best
  choice, but it's where I'm at now. My end goal for this milestone is to remove
  all the unsafe bits. The reason I'm using the unsafe parts, though, is that
  `TVar`s operate in the `IO` (via `atomically`) monad, and Scotty uses its own
  set of monads (`ActionM` and `ScottyM`). I think this requires the use of
  monad transformers.

Once this is sorted out, I can move to basic auth. It does feel good to write me
some Haskell, though.
