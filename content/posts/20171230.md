So I bombed the AIND, for a variety of reasons. I haven't done a whole
lot of programming in the mean time, except one failed attempt at
writing a simple service manager in Go. A couple of people have started
working through [Open Data Structures](http://opendatastructures.org/);
I'm working on it in C++.

I did enroll in the Machine Learning nanodegree, so we'll see how that
goes. I've gotten through the first practice problem, building a spam
classifier, but I haven't figured out how to get the scikit-learn
classifier to work with a single text message. I've also gotten through
the first optional project, the Titanic survival exploration. It was a
little bit of a pain to sift through the data, but I finally got to a
more than 80% accuracy (80.36%!). Now, I'm through the model training
and testing section and working on the first actual graded project.

I've been kicking around the idea of building a robot again --- using
LIDAR to build up an environment. This would be a simplified robot,
using the 4WD chassis I have, with only a servo-mounted LIDAR.

A friend told me about [The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00338QENI/)
and combined with the theme of the new season of Black Mirror (uploaded
souls) has been making me think about AI ethics. As I read through the
book, I'll be keeping an eye for parallels between the two.
