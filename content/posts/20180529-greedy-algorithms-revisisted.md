I was talking to Wally this morning about last night's post, and as I continued
with the class, I realised there's a video series about the fractional knapsack.
*Mea culpa*, I guess the lesson learned is finish the videos before starting the
programming problems.

Anyways, the takeaway from the greedy algorithms lecture is that the problem
space should be sorted: that will give a pretty clear indication of the optimal
(and safe) first move.

There will probably be more to follow later.
