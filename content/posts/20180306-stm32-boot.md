Title: STM32 boot

For the bluepill, I wanted to be able to write a standard C++ program
with a main function and whatnot, and not have to deal with the weird
vector struct mapping; I pulled up the datasheet and found the table with
the listing of the vector table. I put this into an assembly file and
when I got home, tried to use this to run a basic blink demo. However,
the LED didn't blink. I fired up OpenOCD and went to debug it; stepping
through it seemed to be working until two steps later:

```
$ step
target halted due to single-step, current mode: Handler HardFault
xPSR: 0x00000003 pc: 00000000 msp: 0x000000e0
halted: PC: 0x00000000
```

I spent a while trying to get figure out what was going on; my `startup.s`
file looked pretty much like everyone else's, but no luck. It took a while
for me to realise that I was double mapping addresses. That is, the linker
script I had was defining the flash start at an offset, then uploading to
another offset. The fix was straightforward:

```
-    rom (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 128K
-    ram (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 20K
+    flash (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 128K
+    sram (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 20K
```

The renaming is incidental.

Now I have the following linker script:

```
MEMORY
{
    flash (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 128K
    sram (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 20K
}

SECTIONS
{
   .text : { *(.text*) } > flash
   .bss  : { *(.bss*) } > sram
}
```

and the following startup code:

```
/*
 * Startup code for the STM32F103-based blue pill board.
 *
 * The stack pointer is initialised to the top of the stack (which
 * grows downward), so I pointed it to the end of the SRAM (where the
 * stack should be).
 */

.cpu cortex-m3
.thumb

.globl	vectors
vectors:
.align	2
.long	0x20005000		/* stack pointer points to top of SRAM */
.long	reset_handler		/* reset handler */
.long	0			/* NMI handler */
.long	0			/* hard_fault_handler */
.long	0			/* memory management handler */
.long	0			/* bus fault handler */
.long	0			/* usage fault handler */
.skip	0x20			/* reserved */
.long	0			/* svcall handler */
.long	0			/* debug handler */
.skip	4			/* reserved */
.long	0			/* pendsv handler */
.long	0			/* systick handler */
.skip   0x100			/* remaining / IRQ vectors */

.thumb_func
reset_handler:
	bl	main
```

This appears to work, but occasionally gets weird and I have to re-flash
the blink demo from the [previous post](/posts/2018/03/05/programming-a-blue-pill-board-with-the-st-link-v2/).

I'll do some more investigating.
