Just learned this in Prolog, and the definition is beautiful:

```prolog
append([], L, L).
append([H|T], L2, [H|L3]) :- append(T, L2, L3).
```

Declarative programming is way outside my normal methods of thinking --- it
definitely takes some getting used to. From the [tutorial](http://learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse24):

> [This] illustrates a more general theme: the use of unification to build
> structure. In a nutshell, the recursive calls to `append/3` build up this
> nested pattern of variables which code up the required answer. When Prolog
> finally instantiates the innermost variable `_G593` to `[1, 2, 3]`, the
> answer crystallises out, like a snowflake forming around a grain of dust.
> But it is unification, not magic, that produces the result.
