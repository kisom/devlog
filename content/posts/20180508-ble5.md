After today's [monologue](/posts/2018/05/08/2018-05-08/) on the state
of things, I managed to get some hardware work in tonight --- including
breaking out the soldering iron.

I got my Adafruit and Sparkfun packages today and managed to

+ solder headers on the [Adalogger Featherwing](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-adalogger-featherwing/) and my two feathers
+ dig up an SD card and CR1220 battery for the Adalogger
+ in the process, found my old [TECS](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems)
  work from my Africa deployment --- alongside an old picture of me
  with some French marines on a desert warfare and survival course
+ initialise the RTC with the current date and time
+ verify the SD card

So now, I've got an additional couple of functions in the sketch to append
a timestamp and supposed battery level to a logfile. The only problem is
that I'm not getting a good voltage level, just a zero. I'm going to let
the sketch run overnight anyways as the timestamps will give me a baseline
run time idea for the radio usage.

The current sketch is [here](https://github.com/kisom/sketchbooks/blob/7523641fd1c59df2affb3fb7521f8146d21742fb/arduino/envnet/beacon_prototype/beacon_prototype.ino).

Here we go!
