Giving Rust another go; I forgot how much I like the test annotations
to quickly test code as you go. I haven't gotten to the ownership
model yet, which is where I stumbled last time, or to modules, which
would be interesting.

Also spent some time today getting the Chromebook re-set back up. There's
some still very-manual initial bits, before the wireless card and network
manager are up.
