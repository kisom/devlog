I was supposed to write a TUI for GraphBook today. I wasn't really
successful; I was trying to learn curses and figure out how that
works. I was also more distracted today, which I need to double down
on tomorrow.

I did get a sort of proto-interface using the Python ``curses`` library,
but I think urwid will be a better option going forward and I'm going
to try to get something together with that.
