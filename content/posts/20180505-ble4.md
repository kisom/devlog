Started trying to parse the advertising packets. I get something back like
[this dump](/files/gdb-advertising-packet-dump.txt).

The [reference](https://support.kontakt.io/hc/en-gb/articles/201492492-iBeacon-advertising-packet-structure)
I found for the iBeacon format indicates that the data I'm looking for
is in the manufacturer-specific data, which I dumped:

```
f1:02:0a:f4:64:34 is not a valid iBeacon.           
Manufacturer data:        
59 00 02 15  45 4e 56 53                         
42 00 00 00  33 05 00 00
6e 25 cb d8  01 00 01 00
d3  
```

So I see the first `uint16_t` representing the manufacturer ID I
set in the sketch running on the Bluefruit:

```
#define MANUFACTURER_ID	0x0059
```

What I don't see is the UUID that I set in the sketch:

```c++
uint8_t beaconID[16] = {
	0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c,
	0x6f, 0x2c, 0x20, 0x77,
	0x6f, 0x72, 0x6c, 0x64,
	0x21, 0x6b, 0x64, 0x69
};
```

When I run the locate app on my phone, though:

[![locate app running on the Nexus 5X](/files/images/beacon_locate_s.jpg)](/files/images/beacon_locate.jpg)



Note that `f1:02:0a:f4:64:34` is my nRF52 device. The UUID that the app
sees translates to

```c++
uint8_t beaconID[16] = {
	0x45, 0x4e, 0x56, 0x53,
	0x42, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
	0x5a, 0x29, 0x00, 0x00,
	0x8e, 0xb7, 0x31, 0xf1
};
```

The first eight bytes match the manufacturer data at offset 3.

Reading [the mbed page on iBeacons](https://os.mbed.com/blog/entry/BLE-Beacons-URIBeacon-AltBeacons-iBeacon/)
gives some idea of what's supposed to go in the header. None of this
matches what I'm seeing so far.

The next thing I wanted to try was turning off the additional scan response
data, so I started picking through the code. And that's when I remembered
I hadn't updated the beaconsense code to use my updated scheme (fixed UUID,
major -> sensor, minor -> reading), and was still using the packet UUID format.

All right, let's try this out real quick. Now we get

```
Beacon: f1:02:0a:f4:64:34
Manufacturer data: 
59 00 02 15  68 65 6c 6c 
6f 2c 20 77  6f 72 6c 64
21 6b 64 69  02 00 10 27
d3  
```

And with the corresponding updates to the scanner code:

```
-----
Beacon: f1:02:0a:f4:64:34
        Major: 2
        Minor: 10000
Beacon: f1:02:0a:f4:64:34
        Major: 2
        Minor: 10000
Beacon: f1:02:0a:f4:64:34
        Major: 2
        Minor: 10000
Beacon: f1:02:0a:f4:64:34
        Major: 2
        Minor: 10000
Beacon: f1:02:0a:f4:64:34
        Major: 0
        Minor: 100
Beacon: f1:02:0a:f4:64:34
        Major: 0
        Minor: 100
Beacon: f1:02:0a:f4:64:34
        Major: 0
        Minor: 100
```

Voil√°! Looks like we're getting somewhere.
