I got it in my head to work on the environmental sensors I've had in my head
for a while, but with a caveat: I wouldn't buy any new hardware until I had
a working prototype or technology demonstrator. Fortunately, I was able to
borrow an unused hardware platform from a friend of mine.

The basic idea is this: a variety of self-contained sensors broadcast
measurements, and I can use both a Raspberry Pi in my house to pick up those
broadcasts and store them, as well as use my phone to check in on the state of
things. Each sensor node will have the standard environmental sensors
(temperature, humidity, air pressure), and I'd like to include soil sensors,
too.

The demonstrator platform is an [Adafruit nRF52 feather
board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406), which can be programmed with the
Arduino IDE (but not PlatformIO yet, unfortunately). I've got a working beacon
on it, but now I run into some of the challenges I need to sort out. It's been
interesting because I have no experience with Bluetooth except pairing devices
to my phone and cursing at them when they don't work. The [sketch](https://github.com/kisom/sketchbooks/blob/master/arduino/envnet/beacon_prototype/beacon_prototype.ino) is surprisingly short, too.

The first challenge is the size limitation of a beacon: 16 bytes as the ID
field. I don't know how I'm going to fit multiple sensor readings in that; I
still need to write up a quick experiment to play with sizing. There's apparently
an additional 27 bytes that can be sent as an advertising response, but this has
to be explicitly requested. The beacon can be described as

```c++
struct Beacon {
	uint8_t	id[16];
	uint8_t major;
	uint8_t minor;
};
```

The second challenge has been getting this working from Android. The
[ke:tai](http://ketai.org/) library has Bluetooth support, but it looks like
it's limited to connected devices, not advertising devices. I've never really
spent any time programming Android, and I've spent almost no time writing Java,
so this has been an interesting experience. I kept running into permissions
problems on my Android sketches, for example --- not realising I had to include
certain Bluetooth permissions. My current test
[sketch](https://github.com/kisom/sketchbooks/blob/master/arduino/envnet/beacon_prototype/beacon_prototype.ino)
just uses debug printing because my UI skills are still pretty shaky.

### Hardware thoughts

At this point, I'm not sure that BLE is the right approach, and might have to
look into LoRa or Zigbee. There is no *bee feather from Adafruit, but there is
a [LoRa one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3178). I'd also been looking at
the [Particle mesh series](https://www.particle.io/mesh/), particularly the
[Xenon](https://www.particle.io/mesh/buy/xenon/), but the next round of boards
ships out in September, and I wasn't on that. So, it looks like the feathers
for actual, acquirable hardware.

The one thing about LoRa is that I need to add something to the Raspberry Pi to
support it, and then figure out how to access said hardware programmatically.

### Going forward

There's basically a few options I have going forward:

1. I can find a way to get the sensor measurements inside the advertising
   packet. One idea Ihttps://www.particle.io/mesh/buy/xenon/ have for this is using the first four bytes as a node ID,
   one byte as a sensor ID and three bytes for the reading sequence number (to
   correlate multiple sensor readings), four bytes with the reading, and the
   last four as a CRC32 over the first 12 bytes. Then, the sensor will transmit
   one advertisement for each physical measurement it's taken.

2. I can compact the readings to fit in 16 bytes --- not likely. This would require
   a fixed sensor format, which limits what sensors I can use in the network. But,
   if I did do this, I could use a bit field to indicate which sensors were present
   so as to tell a 0 as being an actual measurement v. no measurement was taken.

3. I can switch to a connected format, e.g. having the Raspberry Pi connect to the
   sensors. Then, my phone would connect to the Raspberry Pi on my internal network.
   This would enable a larger data transfer. However, Bluetooth on Linux isn't the
   best, so this could be sketchy.

4. I can evaluate an alternative mesh radio approach, e.g. using LoRa or Zigbee. I've
   not worked with LoRa, and I'd rather avoid Zigbee, but these are options.

I'm glad I went with the tiny demonstrator setup instead of spending a bunch of
money on yet more dev boards. It's enough to get me to want to pick up some of
my own stuff, though.
