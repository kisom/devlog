First June post! Okay, so lots of interviews last week has highlighted a lot of
my weaker areas. Some interesting things to work on, like learning how to think
about systems design better.

I'm caught up on the Algorithmic Toolbox class, still just doing the bare
minimum to pass for reasons of time.

I'm pretty ahead of the curve with the linear algebra class; I think my next
assignments for both classes are due in two weeks. There was a fun matrix
problem that took me a while to solve, but that was because I misunderstood
how to solve the problem. The problem is something like:

```
Convert A to row-echelon form (solve for the a's and r's below):

   1   1   1   15  →   1   a1  a2       r1
   3   2   1 → 28  →   0   1   a3       r2
   2   1   2   23  →   0   0   1        r3
```

What I missed was that the substitution part is equivalent to doing
substitution in a system of equations: you do pairs of rows, not operating on
all three. Once I had figured that out, it was easy to write some Python to run
on my new [numworks](https://www.numworks.com/) calculator and solve the
problem without having to stare at my laptop. The first time I took the quiz
with the problem, I failed. The next round, I passed because I understood on a
more intuitive level what was going on, and I could use my calculator to handle
the tedious parts of calculation.

As for programming, I've been working on a query engine.
