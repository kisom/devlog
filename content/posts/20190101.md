Today marks the start of my unemployment plan: learning React enough
to build a React frontend for my whereami service. I'm working through
the book [React Quickly](https://www.manning.com/books/react-quickly),
and the goal is to have a working web frontend by the end of the
week. That seems tenable if this is the only thing I'm focusing on.

It does mean backgrounding my kforth plans, sort of letting them
simmer in the background.
