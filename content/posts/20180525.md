It turns out there was a ["Maths for Machine
Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)
specialization on Coursera, so I signed up for and hot damn, this is fun. One
of the early quizzes was solving systems of equations for two and three
variables; it took a bit of work to remember how to do it (not using the *A \\
b* trick). The early part is all just going over vectors, which I have a pretty
solid handle on, so it's going quickly. We'll see how it goes when things pick
up.

I also got back on track with the algorithms class.

But yeah, mostly maths the past couple of days. I'm excited; once I get through
the LA stuff, I can start taking a crack at the [Rigetti
QVM](http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) stuff again.
