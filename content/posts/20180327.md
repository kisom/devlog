At work, I've been stuck doing ops stuff lately (mind numbingly boring), so,
I've been following along with
[bitwise](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise), and today I actually learned
some new C things, making today not a complete waste. One of them is a C99
thing; admittedly, I haven't done much C99 in my time. The other relates to
unions, which I also haven't done much with --- I've never really had much use
for them. The finally is a way to print non-NULL terminated C strings (aka
substrings).

## C99 variadic macros

One thing Per does in bitwise is define tests that just get run all the time.
When I'm working on the development side of things, I want these to display
some output, but in a release build, I don't want them to display anything. I
also don't want to set the `NDEBUG` flag, neutering assertions so I've got
something like the following:

```c
#ifndef RELEASE
#define tprint(...)	do { fprintf(stderr, __VA_ARGS__); } while (false)
#else
#define tprint(...)	do {} while (false)
#endif
```

In a function, I might have

```c
uint64_t
that_thing(uint64_t val)
{
	return val;
}


static void
test_that_thing(void)
{
	uint64	x = 0;

	tprint("test_that_thing\n");
	x = that_thing(47);
	assert(x == 47);
	tprint("x = %lu", (long unsigned)x);
	tprint("OK\n");
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	test_that_thing();

	// normal program stuff
}
```

I've got my `all` target set to:

```make
.PHONY: all
all: $(TARGET)
	./$(TARGET)
```

and then I run a `watch make` in a terminal. Works pretty well, and the
resulting program keeps its self-checks baked in.

## Unions and anonymous structs

I also learned that you can use a union with an anonymous struct to add fields
to a struct:

```c
struct Thing {
	int	type;
	union {
		uint64_t	val;
		struct {
			int start;
			int end;
		};
	};
};
```

## Substrings

Printing a substring is done with:

```c
/* substr.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int
main(void)
{
	char buf[] = "hello, world!";
	printf("%.*s\n", (int)4, buf+1);
}
```

Building and running this:

```c
$ make substr
cc     substr.c   -o substr
$ ./substr
ello
```

This is really useful; I don't know how I never knew about it!
